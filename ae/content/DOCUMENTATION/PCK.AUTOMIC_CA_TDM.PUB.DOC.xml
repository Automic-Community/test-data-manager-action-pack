================================
CA Test Data Manager offers an automated solution to one of the most time-consuming and resource-intensive problems in Continuous Delivery -- creating, maintaining and provisioning of the test data needed to rigorously test evolving applications. CA Test Data Manager uniquely combines elements of data subsetting, masking and synthetic, on-demand data generation to enable testing teams to meet the agile needs of the organization.
With this package, we can automate the following
* Submit Publish Job
* Get Publish Job Status

=Supported CA TDM versions=
* 4.0

=Limitations=
(none)

=Setup=
* The Agent should be able to access Test Data Manager rest API endpoint URL in order to make HTTP requests.
* Modify the HTTP timeout parameters as per your environment. By default "CONNECTION_TIMEOUT" is defined as 30000 and "READ_TIMEOUT" is defined as 60000. Both are defined in milliseconds. 0 means no timeout.

=Variables=
PCK.AUTOMIC_CA_TDM.PRV.PROMPTSET.GET_PUBLISH_JOB_STATUS
* To get the status of published job.
Job ID 
*The Job ID to get the job status. 

PCK.AUTOMIC_CA_TDM.PRV.PROMPTSET.SUBMIT_PUBLISH_JOB
*  To submit the publish data job in the TDM
JSON Configuration
* Enter the data that needs to be published on TDM.

PCK.AUTOMIC_RA_REST.PUB.PROMPTSET.CONNECTION_ENDPOINT
* Provide the endpoint URL for the application in this prompt set.
URL Endpoint
* This URL specifies the entry point of the REST service. For example, http://localhost/ARA/api/data/v1/ is the URL Endpoint of the ARA REST API. The relative resource location (specified on the request tab) is appended to this URL during runtime such as http://localhost/ARA/api/data/v1/content 

PCK.AUTOMIC_RA_REST.PUB.PROMPTSET.CONNECTION_AUTH_BASIC
* Basic authentication can be achieved by providing the required inputs in this prompt set. 
Username
*The user name to access the specified system.
Password
*The password corresponding to the user selected.
Host
*The host to connect to. Only required if the endpoint differs from the authentication host.
Port
*The port to use. Only required if the endpoint differs from the authentication host.
Realm
*The realm. Only required if the endpoint differs from the authentication host. Also, this field is optional when a host is specified.
Preemptive
*Activates preemptive authentication. Preemptive authentication sends the authentication information without waiting for the server to give an unauthorized response. This reduces some overhead and may be required in cases where the server does not reply with an unauthorized response. You use preemptive authorization when you trust the endpoint enough to send authentication credentials somewhere without being asked for them.

PCK.AUTOMIC_RA_REST.PUB.PROMPTSET.CONNECTION_PROXY
* proxy settings are specified in this prompt set.
Server Type
*Allows you to select HTTP or SOCKS as server type or to leave the default of No Proxy to not use a proxy server.
Host
*The host where the proxy server resides.
Port
*The port of the proxy server.
Username
*The user to pass to the proxy server.
Password
*The password to pass to the proxy server (if required).
Realm
*The realm.
Authentication Method
*If the proxy server selected in the Server Type field is HTTP, this field allows you to select Basic, Digest or NTLM as the authentication.

PCK.AUTOMIC_RA_REST.PUB.PROMPTSET.CONNECTION_ADVANCED
* Connection timeout and read timeout parameter can be configured in this prompt set.
Connection Timeout (s)
*The number of seconds before timing out while attempting to connect to the URL endpoint. When set to 0, the connection never times out. The default is 30 seconds.
Read Timeout(s)
*The number of seconds before timing out when waiting for a method call. When set to 0, the read never times out. The default is 60 seconds.
Follow Redirects
*Specifies that the request should follow site redirects. For example, if you are trying to get to http://test.com and that site redirects to http://newtest.com, the request will automatically follow the redirect and connect with http://newtest.com.

PCK.AUTOMIC_RA_REST.PUB.PROMPTSET.CONNECTION_RA_AGENT
* For overwriting the default agent.
Overwrite RA Agent
* Select the agent, which will overwrite the default agent.
